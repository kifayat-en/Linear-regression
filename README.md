`Multiple Linear Regresssion with graphs and LR metrics`

**MAE — Mean Absolute Error**
**MAE = average(|actual − predicted|)**

Tells on average how much your prediction is wrong.     
Uses absolute difference.       

Example     
Actual = 100     
Predicted = 90      
Error = |100 − 90| = 10     

If MAE = 8        
model is wrong by 8 units on average      
Advanateges:      
Easy to understand     
Same unit as target    
Disadvantages:       
Treats small & big errors same
